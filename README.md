# QTimeClock
This is a GUI application to clock the working hours of employees. It is written in C++/Qt.

This software tracks the working hours of employees and also records the projects they are working on. Data is stored in a sqlite database. Here, I only provide a screenshot (see the file "start.png") of the application. Please send me an email if you are interested in the code. I will try to get it to you as soon as possible.
